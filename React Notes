REACT BASICS
React is a JavaScript Library for building user interfaces
Libraries simplify building complex interactive and reactive UI

React is Component based
- all user interfaces are made of components
    - Buttons
    - Drop Downs
    - Repeated items with different data

Components are reusable bits of UI elements

React uses components because they are reusable and allows us to separate concerns (small separate use files)

Components are built using HTML CSS and JavaScript through React calls

Define the desired target state(s) and let React figure out the actual JavaScript DOM instructions

Create the react app by using Node.js code
    npx create-react-app expense-tracker
