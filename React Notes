REACT BASICS
React is a JavaScript Library for building user interfaces
Libraries simplify building complex interactive and reactive UI

React is Component based
- all user interfaces are made of components
    - Buttons
    - Drop Downs
    - Repeated items with different data

Components are reusable bits of UI elements

React uses components because they are reusable and allows us to separate concerns (small separate use files)

Components are built using HTML CSS and JavaScript through React calls

Define the desired target state(s) and let React figure out the actual JavaScript DOM instructions

Create the react app by using Node.js code
    npx create-react-app expense-tracker
    cd into expense-tracker
    npm start to start the server

JSX CODE
Built by React team
Stands for JavaScript XML
It is HTML code inside JavaScript
Transforms into DOM Objects once it is compiled

===================================================================

STATE

allows react to re-evaluate component data as it changes.

States are brought in as a hook via named import from React like this

    import React, { useState } from 'react';

and called as a method inside the component arrow function.

    const ExpenseItem = (props) => {  
        useState();
        ...
    }

Use state registers the value for a certain component instance. Each component has its own state managed independently by react.
