JSX CODE

jsx code is javascript code that has an XML format. It needs to be compiled into JavaScript in order to be used on the web.

It uses React.createElement() method to return the html/xml

  return (React.createElement('div', {}, 
    React.createElement('h2', {}, "Let's get started!"), 
    React.createElement(Expenses, {items: expenses}))
  );

rather than the jsx
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Let's get started!</h2>
      <Expenses items={expenses} />
    </div>
  );
